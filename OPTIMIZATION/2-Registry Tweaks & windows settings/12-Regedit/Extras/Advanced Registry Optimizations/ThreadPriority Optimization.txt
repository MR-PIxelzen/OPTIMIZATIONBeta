ThreadPriority definition:
Priority of a thread describes how early it gets execution and selected by the thread scheduler. The 
higher the number, the faster the execution time (ISR).


This tweak can result in lower latency and slightly higher performance. Remember, this comes at a 
risk, make sure to follow everything correctly and read the ReadMe for the disclaimer. Make sure to use MSI 
mode Utility and Interrupt Affinity Tool before this and make sure you've rebooted after completing them 
before doing this tweak.


Steps:
1. Open regedit.exe and go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
2. Choose what services you will apply the tweak to (examples: DXGKrnl, USBXHCI, 
   USBHUB3, amdkmdap [AMD GPUs only], nvlddmkm [NVIDIA GPUs only])
3. Click on the “Parameters” key and make a new REG_DWORD (32-bit) value, 
   “ThreadPriority” and set the value to 1f/f (1f is realtime critical, f is high)
4. Then continue for the rest of the services you choose.


If you can't find the “Parameters” key, right click on the service key and create a new key named 
“Parameters” to fix that issue. Make sure to double check your changes to ensure no issues will occur 
by this tweak!

A example of correct syntax:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\mouhid\Parameters]
"ThreadPriority"=dword:0000001f
