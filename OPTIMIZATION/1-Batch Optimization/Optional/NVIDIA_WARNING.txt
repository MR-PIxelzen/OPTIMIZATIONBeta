The latest version of NVIDIA Inspector on latest drivers doesn't support changing SILK settings or Low Latency settings.

The Tweaks Pack will unlock these settings in NVIDIA Control Panel for you.

Once the first step of the pack completes, you can go ahead and open NVIDIA Control Panel and set:
• SILK to OFF
• Low Latency to Ultra
